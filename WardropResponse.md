The "Top-Down" Method uses census data that is collected on a large scale and distributed across administrative areas. 
That data is then overlayed with geospatial covariates in order to accurately estimate population densities in that given area 
with the already given population numbers from the census data. The "Bottom-Up" approach also utilizes census data, except it uses 
microcensus data that is collected with the same rigor and care a national census would be collected with except on a much smaller scale.
Multiple microcensus' are collected across multiple administrative areas which are then overlayed with covariates. This is then use to 
predict the population densities of the unknown regions that did not have a microcensus conducted on them. The advantages of the "Top-Down"
approach include overall accuracy due to the population numbers being rather clear in a given area, with the covariates used to polish the 
distribution that will be mapped. The "Bottom-Up" approach is beneficial in that because most low-middle income countries aren't able to 
collect big census data that is used by the "Top-Down" approach, a microcensus is easier to collect in terms of efficiency and price while 
not sacrificing a lot of accuracy in predictions. An example of the "Bottom-Up" approach has been used in Nigeria, where small area micro-
census surveys and geospatial covariates are being used to estimate population sizes for vaccination efforts. Examples of the"Top-Down" 
approach include any method that allocates population with covariates that relate to population density such as distance to roads or 
land cover.
