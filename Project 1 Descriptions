Part 1: The first image consists of Bhutan divided into its 20 districts (adm1) and 205 gewogs (group of villages) (adm2).
        The districts varied greatly in terms of the sub-divisions within them, as some districts such as the Gasa districts would only 
        have 4 large sub-divisions within it. In contrast, other districts like the Trashigang district contain 13 gewogs. 
        This was a rather minor complication in that finding a text size that wasn't too small for the large districts but also not too
        big to fit within the smaller gewogs. 
        
Part 2: This image consists of Bhutan with its population densities in each district modelled on. The color gradient represents the 
        population densities, with red districts being more dense than green districts. It is seen that most districts have a
        rather low to medium density when compared to Thimphu, the country's capital, which has the highest population density. 
        
Part 3: This image consists of both a bar plot and the spatial map plot. The bar plot ranks the population densities for the districts
        from highest to lowest. The spatial plot is similar to the one in part 2 except for the fact that the population density
        in persons / km ^2 are now included on each district.
